This is psmouse with patch

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.input/49651

(actually, I haven't applied the patch fully, just made it detect the correct version)

See `install.sh` about installation

Keywords: Dell E5570 AlPS touchpad 73 03 28

If you have Dell Latitude E5570 (or similar) and your touchpapd is detected as 

`ImPS/2 BYD TouchPad`

Then after installing the gmane patch, it will be correctly detected as

`AlpsPS/2 ALPS GlidePoint`
